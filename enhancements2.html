		<h2>Accordian</h2>
		<p>To reduce the clutter and length of the <a href="topic.html" >information page</a>, accordians were implemented to help section the page make it more digestable.
		This was achieved by implementing JavaScript code from the W3 schools webpage, that looped through each button responding to a click command.
		Using nextElementSibling, the webpage was able to retrieve the block and toggle the block on and off
		In addtion to this, the headings on the page were replaced with buttons, and modeled with CSS to repicate the look of the headings</p>

		<h2>Scroll to top button</h2>
		<p>When the user starts to scroll down the <a href="topic.html" >information page</a>, a button will appear in the bottom left conoer of the page and allow the used to scroll imediently to the top of the page.
		So when pages, such as the information page, get lengthy, the quick scroll button allows the user get to the top, and would allow for pages to grow in the future.
		The code was used from the W3 schools library of CSS and JavaScript, using fixed and z-index elements to keep its place and using body.scrollTop and document.scrollTop initiate the function.
		body.scrollTop and document.scrollTop were used to make compatibility on Safari and Firefox/Chrome browsers.</p>
