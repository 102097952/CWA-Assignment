		<h2>Advanced Features</h2>
		<p>Hereâ€™s a list of some of the extra features and content found throughout the website using both CSS and HTML</p>

		<h2>The fixed navigation side bar</h2>
		<p>Rather than having the user scroll from the bottom to the top of the page to access the other webpages, having a fixed scroll bar on the side allows easy access across the pages. 
			This is most effective in longer pages such as the <a href="topic.html" >information page</a> and <a href="quiz.html" >quiz page</a>, when you scroll down the page, the navigation bar will follow.  
			This was achieved using the position command in CSS, keeping the list stay in place.
			A number of other elements were added such as list-style-type to remove the bullet points and margin to keep all items in line with each other. 
			This design looks and interacts a lot more simple and intuitive than a navigation bar at the top of the screen. 
			This code was provided from W3 Schools website</p>

		<h2>YouTube video</h2>
		<p>
			The YouTube video link allows for external sources to provide addition content to your website. 
			Compared to plain text, the addition of videos allows for visual and auditory engagement for the users, for both education and entertainment. 
			I used a video by Techquickie to explain the usage of TCPs and IPs to help further engage and educate the user in the <a href="topic.html" >infomation page</a>. 
			Using the iframe element from W3 schools, I could adjust the size of the video frame and link to the appropriate video in the HTML code.
